Problem Statement:
Create a Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. 
The game should detect winning conditions (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare a winner. 
If all the cells are filled, and no winner is found, the game should declare a draw.

case 1:
Player X Wins: If Player X successfully places their marker (X) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern, they win the game.

case 2:
Player O Wins: If Player O successfully places their marker (O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern, they win the game.

case 3:
Draw: If all positions on the game board are occupied, and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game ends in a draw.



Initialization of Tic Tac Toe Class
 

Logic:
In the __init__ method, we set up the initial state of the Tic Tac Toe game. 
We start with the current player set to "X", indicating that "X" will be the first to play.
To represent the game board, we created a 3x3 matrix called a board. 
Initially, all positions on the board are empty, represented by empty strings.
Next, we create a Tkinter window, the graphical interface for the game, and set its title to "Tic Tac Toe".
We use nested loops to create a 3x3 grid of buttons for the game board. 
Each button is associated with the make_move function using a special technique called a lambda function. 
This allows us to handle button clicks and call the make_move function with the corresponding row and column indices.
Finally, we display the buttons on the Tkinter window using the grid method, and we store references to the buttons in the self. buttons list for easy access later.
Overall, the __init__ method sets up the game by initializing the player, creating the game board, creating the Tkinter window, and generating the buttons for the game board.

Code:
The __init__ function initializes the Tic Tac Toe class.
The current_player variable keeps track of the current player (initially set to "X").
The board variable represents the game board as a 3x3 list, initialized with empty strings.
The window variable represents the main application window created using tk.Tk().
The window is titled "Tic Tac Toe".
The buttons list is initialized to hold the references to the button widgets in the 3x3 grid. 
Buttons are created using tk.Button and added to the grid using the grid method. 
Each button is assigned a command to call the make_move method with the corresponding row and column.


Handling Player Moves
 

Logic:
When a player makes a move by clicking on a button, the make_move function is called. 
It takes the row and column indices of the clicked button as parameters.
The function checks if the clicked position on the board is empty.
If it is, the function updates the board with the current player's symbol and displays it on the button.
Then, it checks if the current player has won by calling the check_winner function. 
If there's a win, a message box is shown with the winner's symbol, and the game is terminated.
If there's no win, the function checks if the board is full by calling the is_board_full function. 
If it's full, a message box is shown indicating a draw, and the game ends.
Otherwise, it switches the current player to the next one.

code:
The make_move function is called when a button is clicked in the grid.
It checks if the clicked cell is empty (represented by an empty string).
If the cell is empty, it updates the cell with the current player's mark ("X" or "O") and updates the button text accordingly.
It then checks if the current player has won by calling the check_winner method with the current player.
If a winner is found, a message box is displayed declaring the winner, and the game is exited by calling self.window.quit().
If the board is full and no winner is found, a message box is displayed declaring a draw, and the game is exited.
Otherwise, it switches the current player for the next turn.

Checking for Victorious Player
 

Logic:
In order to determine if there is a winning condition in Tic Tac Toe, we need to check each row, column, and diagonal of the game board.
First, we'll iterate over each row and check if all three elements in a row are equal and not empty. 
If we find a row where all elements are the same and not empty, we can conclude that a player has won. 
At that point, we return the symbol of the winning player, either 'X' or 'O'.
Next, we move on to checking the columns. 
We iterate over each column and apply the same logic. 
If we find a column where all elements are equal and not empty, we have a winner. 
Again, we return the symbol of the winning player.
To complete our checks, we examine the diagonals. 
There are two diagonals to consider: the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and the top-right to bottom-left diagonal. 
We compare the elements along each diagonal and check if they are equal and not empty. 
If we find a diagonal where all elements satisfy this condition, we have a winner. 
Once more, we return the symbol of the winning player.
If we have iterated through all the rows, columns, and diagonals and have not found a winning condition, we conclude that there is no winner. 
In this case, we return None to indicate a draw.


By following this logic, we can accurately determine if there is a winner in the Tic Tac Toe game.

code:

def check_winner(self, player): - This line defines a method named check_winner that takes self (referring to the class instance) and player as parameters. It is responsible for determining if the specified player has won the game.
for i in range(3): - This line starts a loop that iterates three times, representing the rows of the game board.
if self.board[i][0] == self.board[i][1] == self.board[i][2] == player: - This line checks if all the positions in the current row (identified by i) are occupied by the player. If this condition is met, it means the player has achieved a horizontal win.
if self.board[0][i] == self.board[1][i] == self.board[2][i] == player: - This line checks if all the positions in the current column (identified by i) are occupied by the player. If this condition is met, it means the player has achieved a vertical win.
if self.board[0][0] == self.board[1][1] == self.board[2][2] == player: - This line checks if all the positions in the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are occupied by the player. If this condition is met, it means the player has achieved a diagonal win.
if self.board[0][2] == self.board[1][1] == self.board[2][0] == player: - This line checks if all the positions in the secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are occupied by the player. If this condition is met, it means the player has achieved a diagonal win.
return True - If any of the winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) are satisfied, the function returns True, indicating that the player has won.
return False - If none of the winning conditions are met after iterating through all rows and columns, the function returns False, indicating that the player has not won.
